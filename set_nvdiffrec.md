#Set nvdiffrec

Basically follow nerfstufio -> https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html.
To install CUDA ToolKit I use conda `conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.0" cuda-toolkit`.
Probably nerfstudio is also downloading some additional libraries to make it work.

Still tho, I cannot run the train. At first I got an error and followed this solution -> https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast/issues/92.
Now I have another error and probably the previous fix didn't work.
